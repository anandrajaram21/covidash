# Covidash

Covidash is an open source, community driven COVID-19 dashboard that not only shows the daily statistics of the growing pandemic, but also some forecasts for the growth of the pandemic. 

The forecasts are generated by a Facebook Prophet Model, with the MAPE consistently remaining below 5% for all countries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- The program will run without any issues on any computer, but for a smooth performance, we recommend a system with atleast 4 GB of memory, and atleast 2 CPU cores.
- You must have either Python or Docker(recommended) installed. 
- You must have npm and node installed to take a look at the documentation.
- You must have git installed to clone this repository, or you can just download the zip file.

### Basic Setup
#### 1. On Linux/macOS
##### a. If you have Docker installed
- Run the following commands on a UNIX based system
```
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```
- Open a browser and navigate to 0.0.0.0:8050, and you will see the dashboard

##### b. If you have only Python installed
- Run the following commands on a UNIX based system to get the python environment ready. We are using venv here, as its very simple to get started with
```
python3 -m venv env # Use python instead of python3 if the command throws an error
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Navigate to the web_app directory, and start the app with the following commands
```
cd src/web_app/
gunicorn --bind :8050 --workers 2 --threads 8 app:server # Change the number of workers and threads to your liking
```
- Open a browser and navigate to 0.0.0.0:8050, and you will see the dashboard

#### 2. On Windows
##### a. If you have Anaconda installed (recommended for easy installation)
- Run the following commands in Anaconda Prompt
```
cd <path of the cloned folder>
conda env create -f windows.yml
conda activate covid
python .\src\web_app\app.py # or change directory to web_app and run python app.py
```
If any errors are faced in the installation of pystan, follow the docs as provided here : https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/windows.html

### Documentation
- Run the following commands to start the docusaurus project and navigate to localhost:3000 on your browser.
```
cd docs
npm start
```
### Technologies Used
- Python is the primary programming language used
- Plotly Dash is the framework used to build the web app. (Plotly Dash uses Flask in its underlying implementation, so its very fast)
- Facebook Prophet is the main library used to make the model that forecasts the cases. Some other libraries like Scikitlearn and Tensorflow were also used, but none of them provided as good a speed to accuracy ratio as Facebook Prophet. 
- Plotly is the library used for all the data visualizations and graphs that you see on the dashboard.
- Jupyter Notebooks were used widely for testing our models and our visualizations.
- Docusaurus was used to make the project documentation.
