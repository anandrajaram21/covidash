The success of a project depends on the persistent efforts of an individual projecting it and the sustained support received from a few others who are equally responsible for their precious appreciation of such endeavors. My strength is all due to my honorable Principal Mrs. Pushkala Parasuraman, who has been an unending source of inspiration and support towards the accomplishment of this project. I would like to express my deepest sense of gratitude to my computer teachers Mrs. Padma Pavani Kanukollu and Mrs. Smitha Ravindran without whom I could not have successfully completed this project. I cannot express enough thanks to my Director, Mrs. Deepa Sridhar for the learning opportunities provided by the means of this project.

I would also like to thank all my friends who helped me create such a project. My personal gratitude is extended towards my parents, who have been a constant source of encouragement and support in the success of the project.

Last but not least I want to thank the Almighty for enlightening, strengthening, and guiding me in the completion of this project.
